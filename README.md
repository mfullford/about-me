# About Me

## Before GA:
I was working at a tech start up in DC called Mapbox as HR/Operations/Space Management. Before that, I interned with Amazon my senior year of college (also working in HR).

## Outcomes support I need:
I will need support reviewing my resume and finding Colorado resources (my contacts are all in DC and SF but I want to measure my opportunities in Denver before moving again to SF).

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Understand javascript as it is fundamental to pretty much every dev job.

## Meetups I've attended:
1. The one a bunch of us went to with Zeb, we disccused storage space. (Late September during Denver Start Up week)

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
Start ups are very appealing because you can be given a lot of flexibility in what you're doing and how you do it, the autonomy is really refreshing. However, after working 60+ hours a week at a start up, I am interested in finding a job with a better work/life balance and more opportunities for mentorship (better organizational structure).

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I''m a big fan of the front end. I love being creative and making things come to life. I'm also a big people person and thrive in team environments.
